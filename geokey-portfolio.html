  <h4>Flex your Coding Muscles for Participatory Mapping</h4>
  <p>We’re holding a code sprint and we’d really like your help!</p> 
   <p>  <strong>
      <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/geokey-code-sprint-for-participatory-mapping-tickets-14371849589">Join us</a></strong> for one day of food and fun, to help us grow GeoKey (http://geokey.org.uk/) —a community platform for participatory mapping. 
  </p> 
<p>For us, participatory mapping is a key tool in the DIY toolbox, so we're teaming up with <a href="http://citizencyberlab.eu/">CCL</a> to work on their new open source platform.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Help us shape the future of open mapping</strong>
      <p>GeoKey is an open source project and it’s community-led. Help  shape the future of participatory mapping by building a mapping  platform you would use yourself. 
      </p>

      <strong>You can control your own geo data</strong>
      <p>GeoKey is an alternative to commercial mapping platforms. You can help communities to share data openly and securely, while retaining ownership and full control over your data.
