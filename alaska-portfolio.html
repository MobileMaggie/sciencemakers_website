		 <h2>Barrow ScienceMakers</h2>
		 <p>On the shores of the Arctic ocean, climate change is also changing how subsistence communities hunt for food.
		   Rapidly decreasing ice cover makes hunting perilous and up-to-the-minute information about ice thickness is becoming a
		   matter of life or death.</p>
		 <p>We are working with the Yupik and Inupiaq to develop mobile and sensor technology which will help their hunters
		   to identify change and share their knowledge. Our hope is that this technology will make a difference both to these
		   communities and to our understanding of the effects of climate change.</p>
		 <p>In May, we ran a ScienceMakers hack at Science Museum LATES, where we tried out some of the same basic methods for
		   DIY science hacking that weâ€™ll be using in Alaska. We wired up a few arduino boards with sensors and showed people how
		   to share the information they generated.</p>
		 <p>In July, we'll be heading up to Alaska for another ScienceMakers hack, where we'll be working with STEM students
		   to develop some sensor and mobile data collection projects.</p>
