  <h2>ScienceMakers at Mozfest</h2>
  <h4>Ravensbourne College, Saturday 25 Oct, 3-6 pm</h4>
  <p><strong>Have a look at what we did in the workshop <a href="http://www.mobilecollective.co.uk/?p=1043">here</a>!</strong></p>
  <p>We'll be  <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org">Mozfest2014</a> running a workshop on building Science Apps with <a href="https://apps.webmaker.org">Appmaker</a>, Mozilla's new tool for building mobile apps. </p>
  <p>We're calling the workshop <strong>"Apps for Climate Change: using Appmaker for Citizen Science"</strong>.</p>
  <p> We'll be focussing on how we can use Appmaker as a citizen science tool for  local data collection about the environment. </p>
  <p>Everyone is welcome to attend, whether you're a scientist, a developer, a citizen scientist, or just curious.</p>
  <p>We're aiming to hand the appmaker developers a wish-list of science features, so we'll need as much insight as we can get.</p>
