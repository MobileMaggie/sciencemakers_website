  <h2>ScienceMakers at Mozfest</h2>
  <h4>Ravensbourne College, Saturday , 7 November  noon- 1  pm</h4>

  <p>We'll be  at <a href="http://2015.mozillafestival.org">Mozfest2015</a> again this year, running  a workshop on building an Open IoT Stack for Schools.  </p>
<p> There's been a lot going on lately in the Internet of Things, especially in the area of education.</p>
  <p> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4hVG2Br1W1LKCmw8nSm9WnQ/introducing-the-bbc-micro-bit">The BBC Microbit</a> is of course the biggest change. </p>
  <p>We had a chance to try one out at the <a href="https://twitter.com/bcf5/status/647449414366285824">Over the Air preview</a> and we're sure it will be a game changer.  The Microbit people have built Microbit with capacity for IoT. And the web-based programming interface is a real star. </p>
  <p>There are also many IoT initiatives for schools, including, for the UK, the <a href="http://iotschool.org/">Internet of School Things.</a></p>
										    
<p>So many, in fact, that we're finding it hard to choose. So we thought we'd start a discussion, to lay out a basic framework for an IoT stack and fill in some of the boxes (with choices and ideas about what we'd like to see). </p>
<p>For those of you who've attended our past workshops, this is a bit of a departure for us. It will be more of a community discussion and less of a hands-on event.</p> 								
  <p>Everyone is welcome to attend, whether you're a scientist, a developer, an educator, an IoT enthusiast, , or just curious.</p>
  <p>To get things rolling, we've <strong>started an <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/IOTforSchools_Mozfest_2015">etherpad.</a></strong> We'll be sharing our thoughts there in the days leading up to the workshop and we'd encourage you to do so too, if you feel like contributing. </p>
  <p><strong>What are our workshops like? Have a look at what we did at last year's  workshop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71POZHqv-bU">here</a>!</strong></p>
