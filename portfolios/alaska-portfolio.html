  <h2>Barrow ScienceMakers: Arctic Citizen Science</h2>
  <p>On the shores of the Arctic ocean, climate change is also changing how subsistence communities hunt for food.
    Rapidly decreasing ice cover makes hunting perilous and up-to-the-minute information about ice thickness is becoming a <a href="http://www.adn.com/rural-alaska/article/seal-hunters-rescued-shifting-sea-ice-near-barrow/2011/07/03/">matter of life or death.</a></p>
  <p>We are working with local communities and students  to develop mobile and sensor technology which will help their hunters to identify change and share their knowledge. Our hope is that this technology will make a difference both to these communities and to our understanding of the effects of climate change.</p>
  <p>In May 2014, we ran a ScienceMakers hack at <a href="http://sml-app.mobilecollective.co.uk/">Science Museum LATES</a>, where we tried out some of the same basic methods for DIY science hacking that weâ€™ll be using in Alaska. We wired up a few arduino boards with sensors and showed people how  to share the information they generated.</p>
  <p>In July 2014, we headed up to Alaska for another <a href="http://arcticscience.pbworks.com">ScienceMakers hack</a>, where we  worked with STEM students to develop some sensor and mobile data collection projects.</p>
  <p>Since then, we've been working to develop some of the <a href="http://arcticscience.pbworks.com/w/page/83616382/Outcomes">student projects</a> from the hack, including a <a href="http://arcticscience.pbworks.com/w/page/83616382/Outcomes#GameTracker">mobile app for animal indentification.</a> </p>
