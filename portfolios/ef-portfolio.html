  <h2>ScienceMakers at EF Academy, Oxford</h2>


  <p>Liliana Sanchez Giraud, one of our ScienceMaker Ambassadors, 
    has started a ScienceMakers club at EF Academy in Oxford.</p>
  <p>For their first project, the ScienceMakers at EF 
    are building air quality monitors using arduino boards.</p>
  <p>They will also be making mobile data collection apps using Mozilla <a\
									   href="https://apps.webmaker.org">Appmaker</a>, to collect data about the local environment.</p>
  <p> 
    They're aiming to have the apps ready to show at the AppMaker for <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org/proposals/#science">Citizen Science session</a> at <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org/">Mozfest 2014</a> in London at the end of October</p>
